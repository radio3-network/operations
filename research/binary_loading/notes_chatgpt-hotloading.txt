As I mentioned earlier, the FlashStorage library is designed for storing and retrieving data, not for executing binary code. Therefore, you cannot run code that has been loaded by the FlashStorage library directly.

However, you can use the FlashStorage library to store function pointers or other data structures that reference code stored in flash memory. For example, you could store a pointer to a function that is defined in a separate binary file that has been uploaded to the flash memory of your Arduino board.

To call a function that is stored in flash memory using a function pointer, you can simply dereference the pointer and call the function. Here is an example:


#include <FlashStorage.h>

typedef void (*FunctionPointer)();

// Define a function that is stored in flash memory
const FunctionPointer storedFunction PROGMEM = (FunctionPointer) 0x1000;

void setup() {
  // Initialize the FlashStorage library
  FlashStorage::begin();

  // Store a pointer to the function in flash memory
  FlashStorage::write<FunctionPointer>(0, storedFunction);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the function pointer from flash memory
  FunctionPointer function = FlashStorage::read<FunctionPointer>(0);

  // Call the function
  function();
}

In this example, we define a function pointer type called FunctionPointer that represents a pointer to a function that takes no arguments and returns void. We then define a function called storedFunction that is stored in flash memory at address 0x1000.

In the setup function, we initialize the FlashStorage library and store a pointer to the storedFunction in flash memory at address 0. In the loop function, we read the function pointer from flash memory and call the function by dereferencing the pointer.

Please note that this example is simplified and assumes that the binary file containing the storedFunction is already uploaded to the flash memory of the Arduino board. In practice, you would need to create a custom bootloader that is capable of loading the binary file into flash memory at runtime.
